# Unity Utilities
This library provides a basic set of C# scripts that can be used in Unity games. They are mainly aimed to saving some time and making small quality of life updates to the basic classes with game jams in mind.

## How to install
To use the included scripts, copy the scripts anywhere in your `Assets` folder. It is recommended to use `Assets/Scripts/Generic` and put game-specific scripts in `Assets/Scripts/Game`.
